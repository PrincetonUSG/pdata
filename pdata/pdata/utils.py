  Bulk upsert objects. The queryset `q` is used to retrieve the existing
  objects, and `expected` is a list of dictionarys (mapping field names to
  values). One query is performed to find existing objects, and then the
  updates are performed individually while inserts/deletes are performed in
  bulk. The performance improvements come from the bulk insertions and single
  filter query.

  This operation is *not* performed atomically, so wrap the call to
  `bulk_upsert` in a `transaction.atomic` context if you require it to be
  atomic.

  For N existing objects (to update) and M objects to create, this performs
  N+2 database queries. In comparison, Django's `update_or_create` performs
  2(N+M) queries.

  :param hash_data: hash a dictionary representation of an object to a unique
    value (this will generally be some unique value in the object itself)
  :param expected: set of expected objects (represented as dictionaries) to
    upsert
